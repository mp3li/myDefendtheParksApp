# Final Project Requirements

This document maps the DATA 144 / Mobile Application Development final project requirements to the implemented Defend the Parks by mp3li source code.

## Requirement Summary From TXT

All required items from `[Final Project - Mobile Application Development.txt].txt` are addressed:

| TXT requirement | Status | Implementation proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access the device's location | Met | Where Are We? and Journey Mode request foreground location permission and read coordinates with `expo-location`. |
| Process location data responsibly | Met | Location is requested only after user action, coordinates are displayed back to the user, Native Land records are described as contextual and not legal boundaries, and Journey Mode remains opt-in. |
| Use a background service such as location updates, notifications, or scheduled tasks | Met in source; runtime verification is platform dependent | Journey Mode registers a background location task with `expo-task-manager`/`expo-location`, requests notification/background permissions when enabled, schedules local notifications through `expo-notifications` when returned context changes, and uses 5-minute tab-open polling on web. |
| Listen for at least one broadcast event, system event, or custom event | Met | React Native `AppState` listens for lifecycle events, deep links are handled in the root layout, and Journey Mode stores a custom context-change event. |
| Consume data from an external API | Met | National Park Service API and Native Land API are consumed. |
| Display retrieved data in the application interface | Met | Retrieved NPS and Native Land records display across Home, Search, state pages, park pages, Where Are We?, Nearby Sovereignties, and Journey Mode. |
| Include at least one animated UI element or screen transition | Met | Where Are We? uses an animated spinning compass while getting coordinates; the app also uses fade modal transitions and heading-driven compass rotation. |
| Clearly structured layout and navigation | Met | Fixed title/header, mobile tabs, desktop web nav, Back strip, Return to Homepage, Jump To menu, and sectioned content. |
| User interaction through buttons, inputs, or gestures | Met | State search, park open/save/remove actions, gallery modal, Jump To, Get My Coordinates, Begin/Stop Journey Mode, and refreshable coordinate button. |
| Completed mobile application | Met | Expo React Native app lives in `learning-react-native-app/`. |
| Source code submitted by GitHub link | Met | Source is maintained in the GitHub repo. |
| Brief written description of application features | Met | `README.md` and `/docs` provide feature and requirement documentation. |

## Requirement 1: Location and Background Services

Implemented through **Where Are We?** and **Journey Mode**.

What is implemented:

- Requests foreground location permission with `expo-location`.
- Reads the user's current latitude and longitude.
- Displays the coordinates in the interface.
- Uses those coordinates to request Native Land API records.
- Starts heading updates when location permission is available, with a web tilting/orientation fallback when browser/device support exists.
- Displays an in-app compass when heading data is available.
- Displays the in-app compass on Where Are We? and Journey Mode.
- Provides Journey Mode as an opt-in travel feature started by the **Begin Journey Mode** button and stopped with **Stop Journey Mode**.
- Displays Journey Mode current-location results with the same result structure used by Where Are We?.
- Stores Journey Mode enabled state, last check time, baseline context, and last context-change event with AsyncStorage.
- Updates Journey Mode last-check time during foreground Journey Mode checks.
- Registers a background location task in source code with `expo-task-manager`.
- Compares new returned territory context to the saved baseline when background updates are available.
- Schedules a local notification with `expo-notifications` when Journey Mode detects changed returned context.
- This is local notification scheduling, not remote server push notification infrastructure.
- On desktop web and mobile web, checks for updated Journey Mode coordinate context every 5 minutes while the browser tab remains open.

Implementation locations:

- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/where-are-we.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/journey-mode.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/journey-mode-panel.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/services/location-context.ts`
- `learning-react-native-app/services/journey-mode.ts`
- `learning-react-native-app/tasks/journey-mode-task.ts`

Notification/background source proof:

- `learning-react-native-app/services/journey-mode.ts` lazy-loads `expo-notifications`, requests notification permission, requests background location permission when available, starts `Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync`, and calls `Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync` when the saved context changes.
- `learning-react-native-app/tasks/journey-mode-task.ts` defines the background location task and passes updated coordinates into `processJourneyModeLocation`.
- Expo Go and browser web previews can demonstrate the foreground Journey Mode flow, but native background location and local notification delivery depend on runtime, permissions, and operating-system support.

## Requirement 2: Broadcast Intents and External APIs

The requirement says the app must utilize broadcast intents to interact with system events or external APIs, listen for at least one broadcast event, consume external API data, and display that data.

What is implemented:

- React Native `AppState` listens for system lifecycle events.
- Where Are We? refreshes location context when the app returns active and a coordinate baseline exists.
- Deep links are handled in the root layout:
  - `soft210://where-are-we`
  - `soft210://journey-mode`
- Android note: the Expo deep-link setup maps to intent-compatible app launching without handwritten native Android receiver code.
- Journey Mode stores a custom app event when returned context changes.
- The app consumes the National Park Service API.
- The app consumes the Native Land API.
- Retrieved API data is displayed in Home, Search, state location lists, profile pages, Where Are We?, Nearby Sovereignties, and Journey Mode result surfaces.
- The deployed web app routes NPS requests through a Cloudflare Pages Function so NPS data still loads reliably from the browser.
- The deployed web app validates early access through a Cloudflare Pages Function and a Cloudflare secret, not a hardcoded access code.

Implementation locations:

- `learning-react-native-app/app/_layout.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/where-are-we.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/services/nps-api.ts`
- `learning-react-native-app/services/native-land-api.ts`
- `learning-react-native-app/services/journey-mode.ts`
- `functions/api/nps/[[path]].js`
- `functions/api/access-code.js`

## Requirement 2 Continued: Display Retrieved API Data

External API data is displayed throughout the interface.

NPS API data displayed:

- Featured Park of the Day.
- State lists of national parks and other locations maintained by the National Park Service, including historic sites, trails, memorials, battlefields, monuments, and other NPS designations returned by the API.
- Profile overview.
- Park images.
- Activities and topics.
- Weather guidance.
- Operating hours.
- Addresses and contact information.
- Fees and passes.
- Official park links.

Native Land API data displayed:

- Native Land overview text.
- Placename records.
- Languages.
- Territories.
- Treaties.
- Source/reference links.
- Name meanings when returned.
- Contextual notes about overlapping records and non-legal boundary use.
- Native Land public resources and map tools.

Native Land public resources linked:

- Maps.
- Lists.
- Placenames.
- Risk resources.
- Renewal resources.

Implementation locations:

- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/states/[stateCode].tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/parks/[parkCode].tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/where-are-we.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/park/park-detail-content.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/constants/native-land-resources.ts`

## Requirement 3: User Interface and Animation

What is implemented:

- Fixed app title on every screen.
- Mobile bottom tab navigation.
- Web header navigation.
- Mobile web uses the mobile-style top and bottom navigation while desktop web uses the wider header navigation.
- Web nav icons are rendered without depending on browser icon-font loading, so desktop web and mobile web show the actual icons instead of missing-font boxes.
- Jump To compass menu for long screens.
- Accessible buttons.
- Mobile collapsible preview sections that start partially visible.
- Web sections expanded by default, with National Parks Picture Gallery as the only expandable/collapsible web section.
- Spinning compass loading animation while checking coordinates.
- Where Are We-style Journey Mode result loading and current context surfaces.
- In-app compass on Where Are We? and Journey Mode.
- Full-size image modal for gallery images.
- Back strip with Back and Return to Homepage actions.
- Glassy/dimmed background image system.
- Theme-aware typography and colors.
- Flat glass section styling without nested solid white subcards.

Animation proof:

- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/where-are-we.tsx` defines `LoadingCompass`, which uses React Native `Animated.loop` and `Animated.timing` to rotate the compass from `0deg` to `360deg` while showing `Getting your coordinates...`.
- `learning-react-native-app/components/app-header.tsx`, `learning-react-native-app/components/park/national-parks-picture-gallery.tsx`, and `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` also use `Modal` fade transitions.
- Where Are We? and Journey Mode rotate the in-app compass when heading/tilting data is available.

Implementation locations:

- `learning-react-native-app/components/app-header.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/collapsible-preview-section.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/screen-background.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/accessible-button.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/themed-text.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/ui/icon-symbol.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/where-are-we.tsx`

## Testing, Expo Go, Web Deployment, and Grading Notes

Testing so far has been done primarily on iPhone through Expo. That workflow supports review of the app shell, navigation, API data display, foreground Where Are We? coordinate lookup, heading/compass behavior when available, Saved Parks, Jump To, and the visible Journey Mode screen flow.

The repo includes the Journey Mode background-location and notification implementation in source code, but full background-location runtime behavior can depend on:

- Expo Go versus native build runtime;
- platform permissions;
- operating system background-location rules;
- notification permission choices;
- whether the operating system allows background updates at that moment.

The app-store-style native runtime path is represented in source code, especially:

- `learning-react-native-app/tasks/journey-mode-task.ts`
- `learning-react-native-app/services/journey-mode.ts`
- `learning-react-native-app/app/(tabs)/journey-mode.tsx`
- `learning-react-native-app/components/journey-mode-panel.tsx`

Because my available testing devices are in the Apple ecosystem and a paid Apple Developer account is a financial barrier, I did not distribute an iOS development or app-store build for grading. Instead, the source implementation is documented for review, and the app is deployed on Cloudflare Pages as an accessible web build that demonstrates the foreground GPS/API workflow, Journey Mode start/stop flow, current-location results, and web tab-open polling behavior.

Foreground location lookup, external API display, UI animation, AppState handling, deep-link source, local persistence, and source-level Journey Mode implementation are all available for review through the standard GitHub and Expo workflow.

The deployed web version is available at:

```text
https://defendtheparks.mp3li.online
```

The web deployment is early-access protected. The access code is not published in the repo; it is configured through Cloudflare environment secrets.
