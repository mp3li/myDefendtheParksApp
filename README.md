## About the Project

Defend the Parks by mp3li was built as a final project for **DATA 144 - Data Structures** during my last quarter working toward my Associate Degree in **Software Development and Business Analytics**.

The app is built to feel useful first. It is not only a list of parks, and it is not only a class demo. It is a mobile field-style guide for asking better questions about place: What National Park Service locations are near or connected to a state? What does the National Park Service publish about that place? What Indigenous languages, territories, treaties, placenames, and public Native Land resources are connected to the land? What changes when I physically move somewhere else?

Under the hood, those workflows are supported by structured app state, searchable lists, saved records, API integration, local persistence, GPS-based lookup, background-task source code, and repeatable expandable sections. The project stays practical while demonstrating the final-project requirements through a real user experience.

The app intentionally avoids presenting Native Land data as fixed legal borders. Indigenous sovereignty, language, relationship to land, and public data cannot be flattened into one clean boundary. Defend the Parks presents records as educational context, centers languages when available, and links users back to public source material for further research.

- **Broadcast/system-event coverage:** AppState listener, deep-link handling, and Journey Mode context-change state for the coursework broadcast/system-event requirement.

## How to Use Defend the Parks

### 1. Start on the Homepage

The Homepage is the main guided entry point. It introduces the purpose of the app, explains that Defend the Parks uses National Park Service data and Native Land API data, opens the National Parks Picture Gallery, and shows the Featured Park of the Day with the same meaningful detail structure used on park pages. From the featured park, users can review Indigenous language, territory, treaty, placename, source, and map-tool records; read the National Park Service overview; open stewardship links; check activities, topics, weather, visitor information, fees, directions, and official park links; and save the park locally. Every major page also has the fixed compass **Jump To** menu, so long screens have a page-specific table of contents instead of forcing users to scroll blindly.

### 2. Search by State

Search by State is for browsing National Park Service records geographically. Users search the state list, open a state page, review how many NPS-maintained locations were returned, expand park/location rows for a preview, and tap into a full profile page when they want the complete set of park data and Native Land context.

### 3. Where Are We? Mode

Where Are We? is the current-location mode. After the user gives permission, the app gets exact coordinates, changes the button state so the user can see the coordinates were acquired, starts heading data for the in-app compass when available, calls Native Land API with the coordinates, and displays returned placenames, languages, territories, treaties, source links, public resources, and Nearby Sovereignties.

### 4. Journey Mode

Journey Mode is for road trips, moving through different areas, or any situation where the user wants updated context as they travel. The mode explains the permission model, starts from a deliberate **Begin Journey Mode** action, and uses the same Native Land result structure as Where Are We? so users do not have to learn a second interface.

### 5. Save Parks

Saved Parks keeps selected places available after the user leaves the screen. The saved list shows how many places are saved, displays each saved park name, and gives direct open and remove actions.

## Feature: Where Are We? Mode

Where Are We? is the app's foreground GPS feature. It is designed for the moment a user wants to know what Native Land API records are associated with their current coordinates.

The mode:

- requests foreground location permission only when the user chooses to get coordinates;
- displays a loading compass while location data is being requested;
- shows coordinates directly in the button after a successful lookup;
- uses heading data to power an in-app compass when the device provides it;
- calls Native Land API with latitude and longitude;
- displays returned placenames, languages, territories, treaties, public resources, nearby records, and sources;
- keeps language and treaty wording consistent with park pages and Homepage sections.

The result is not a map replacement and not a legal boundary tool. It is a respectful coordinate-based learning mode that points users toward the records and sources available for where they are.

## Feature: Journey Mode

Journey Mode is the app's travel-aware GPS feature. It is built for movement: road trips, field visits, commutes, or any situation where a user crosses into an area that returns different Native Land API records.

The source code includes:

- Journey Mode start flow;
- stored baseline context;
- background task registration with `expo-task-manager`;
- background location source with `expo-location`;
- local notification source with `expo-notifications`;
- comparison logic for changed Native Land context;
- persisted last-update state;
- shared result rendering with Where Are We?.

Expo Go can show and test the foreground portions of this flow, but full background location and notification behavior is platform/build dependent. For final grading, this project documents the implemented source and can be provided as a development build so the instructor can test the native behavior that Expo Go may not fully run on iPhone.

## Feature: In-App Compass

The in-app compass appears in **Where Are We? Mode** and **Journey Mode**. It is built from React Native views, not a static image: a dark circular face, orange border, faint ivory crosshairs, orange needle, and ivory tail. The same visual language is also used for the fixed header's Jump To compass icon.

The compass uses `expo-location` heading updates through `Location.watchHeadingAsync`. When the device or browser provides heading data, the app rotates the compass by the inverse of the reported heading so the needle points north. If heading data is not available, the app shows a plain prompt instead of pretending it has a reliable compass reading.

The compass does not need NPS API or Native Land API network data to calculate heading. It can work without API responses if the app is already running and the device/browser still provides heading sensor data, but support depends on platform permissions, hardware sensors, and browser/device behavior.

## How It Was Built

| Area | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Expo React Native with Expo Router |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Navigation | File-based tabs and dynamic routes |
| Styling | Shared theme constants, themed components, custom fonts, glass-style section surfaces |
| Fonts | League Spartan Bold for the app title, Aileron Regular and Italic for app text |
| Data | National Park Service API and Native Land API |
| GPS and compass | `expo-location` foreground location and heading data |
| Background task source | `expo-task-manager` |
| Notifications | `expo-notifications` local notification source |
| Local persistence | AsyncStorage and app context state |
| System events | React Native `AppState`, deep-link handling, and Journey Mode context-change state |

## Architecture Flow

```text
User
  -> Expo Router screens
  -> shared themed UI components
  -> service layer
  -> National Park Service API
  -> Native Land API
  -> normalized records
  -> Home, Search, park pages, Where Are We?, Journey Mode, and Saved Parks
```

```text
Where Are We?
  -> user taps Get My Coordinates
  -> app requests foreground location permission
  -> app gets latitude, longitude, and heading when available
  -> app requests Native Land coordinate data
  -> app displays records, nearby sovereignties, resource links, and source links
```

```text
Journey Mode
  -> user taps Begin Journey Mode
  -> app requests needed location/notification permissions
  -> app stores the current Native Land context as a baseline
  -> background task source checks future coordinates
  -> app compares returned context
  -> app schedules a local notification when context changes
```

## Data Sources and API Strategy

Defend the Parks uses two primary external data sources:

| Source | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| National Park Service API | Park and NPS-location records, names, designations, descriptions, images, image credits, activities, topics, weather notes, operating hours, entrance fees, passes, contacts, addresses, directions, and official URLs |
| Native Land API | Coordinate-based and place-based Indigenous language, territory, treaty, source, and available placename records |

The app currently calls these APIs from the Expo app for coursework/testing. For any public web deployment, client-side API keys should be treated as visible because static web bundles cannot keep secrets. A future backend would move protected API calls server-side and would be useful for caching responses, normalizing API data, and protecting rate limits.

## Native Land Context Approach

Native Land records can include overlapping, changing, and layered relationships to land. Defend the Parks handles that carefully:

- Records are described as returned Native Land records, not legal boundary determinations.
- Language records are shown before territories when available.
- Territories and treaties remain visible when returned.
- Placename records are their own section.
- Treaty sections identify returned agreements and link users toward further research without interpreting treaty terms.
- Native Land public resources and map tools are linked separately because they are broader tools, not always exact coordinate-returned records.
- Nearby Sovereignties are approximate and are based on sampled nearby points.

## UI, Styling, and Asset Credits

The app uses a night-forest palette:

| Token | Hex |
| --- | --- |
| Campfire Orange | `#aa5215` |
| Cedar Brown | `#66310c` |
| Pine Shadow | `#151e08` |
| Deep Pine | `#0b1406` |
| Night Black | `#04040c` |

Typography:

| Font | App use | Repo location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| League Spartan Bold | App title and README title image | `learning-react-native-app/assets/fonts/LeagueSpartan-Bold.otf` |
| Aileron Regular | Main body text | `learning-react-native-app/assets/fonts/Aileron-Regular.otf` |
| Aileron Italic | Emphasis/accent text | `learning-react-native-app/assets/fonts/Aileron-Italic.otf` |

Font license files should be kept beside the font files in `learning-react-native-app/assets/fonts/` for final submission once they are added.

Visual assets currently used by the app:

| Asset | App use |

| `evan-wise-mNSSpeJsnQA-unsplash.jpg` | Journey Mode background, photo by Evan Wise on Unsplash |
| National Park Service API images | Park, gallery, featured-location, and profile images with NPS-provided credits shown in the app |

## Setup, API Keys, and Local Development

The Expo project lives in `learning-react-native-app`, so setup commands should run from that folder:

```bash
cd learning-react-native-app
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

Create `learning-react-native-app/.env` with the required National Park Service and Native Land API variables used by the service layer. The variable names are defined in the API service files and should not be committed with real values.

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Testing, Grading, and Platform Notes

Testing so far has been focused on iPhone through the Expo workflow. That verifies the app shell, navigation, styling, NPS API display, Native Land API display, foreground coordinate lookup, heading/compass behavior when available, Saved Parks, Jump To, and manual Where Are We? results.

The Journey Mode source satisfies the implementation side of the background-location/notification requirement, but Expo Go can limit native background location and notification behavior on iPhone. For grading, the source is documented, and a development build can be provided so the instructor can test the native Journey Mode behavior outside Expo Go.

## Future Deployment Direction

The current app does not have a backend. A web version can be built from Expo and hosted as a static app on Cloudflare Pages. In that setup, the browser client can call NPS and Native Land directly, but any key included in the static client should be considered public.

Future iterations may add a backend running on a local iMac or another server. That backend would not be required for the current mobile app to function, but it would be the better architecture for protected API calls, response caching, request normalization, analytics, and future public web deployment polish.

Where Are We? and the foreground part of Journey Mode can work in a web preview when the browser grants geolocation permission. What is different is native background behavior: a browser tab can show current Journey Mode results while it is open, but it should not be described as equivalent to native mobile background tracking and local notifications after the app is backgrounded or closed.
